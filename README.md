# CiviForm

CiviForm aims to simplify the application process for benefits programs by re-using applicant data
for multiple benefits applications. It is being developed by Google.org in collaboration with the
City of Seattle.

See the [latest end-to-end demo](https://youtu.be/glytMu8RTyA) (**NOTE**: This is a work in progress,
so many screens are rough).
